# Overview & Vision

We are a group of technophile guys and have set ourselves the goal of generating the energy consumed in our home ourselves as far as possible.

From this the idea was born to fill our roofs with photovoltaic, to produce as much energy as possible, to store it and to consume it ourselves.

Putting a lot of money in your hand and hiring a service provider with an all-inclusive carefree package is easy. But that was neither our idea nor our goal.

Our approach is as follows:

- from self-assembled components
- with a lot of own work and commitment
- by understanding the components and technologies
- by independent configuration and optimization of the interaction

to achieve the best possible yield using the least possible financial resources.
