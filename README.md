# Overview & Vision

We are a group of technophile guys and have set ourselves the goal of generating the energy consumed in our home ourselves as far as possible.

From this the idea was born to fill our roofs with photovoltaic, to produce as much energy as possible, to store it and to consume it ourselves.
